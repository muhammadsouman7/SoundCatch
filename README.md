**SoundCatch: Catch the sound you love, anytime.**

SoundCatch is a simple, elegant web application that lets you download the audio of your favorite songs by simply typing in the song's name.

This project was born out of a simple idea: to make it easier for people to download the songs they love without having to navigate complex websites or deal with annoying ads. SoundCatch is designed to be fast, straightforward, and user-friendly, bringing your favorite tunes directly to you.


**Features**

1. Effortless Search: Simply enter the name of a song to find and download its audio.
2. High-Quality Audio: The app extracts the best available audio quality from the source.
3. Clean Interface: A minimalist and intuitive user interface designed for a seamless experience.
4. Automatic Naming: Downloads are automatically saved with the correct song title.


**How It Works**

SoundCatch uses a straightforward client-server architecture:
1. Frontend (Web Interface): The user enters a song name into a form on the main page.
2. Backend (Flask Server): The server receives the song name, fetches a direct audio URL using the powerful yt-dlp library with the provided cookies, and sends this URL back to the frontend.
3. Client-Side Download: The user's browser receives the direct audio URL and handles the entire download process, which makes the process faster and more reliable.

The entire process is designed to be quick and efficient, giving you the song you want in a matter of moments.
